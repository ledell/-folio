Currently I am working as a Statistician and Machine Learning Scientist at <a href="http://h2o.ai/">H2O.ai</a>, the company behind the open source machine learning software, <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3">H2O</a>.  Prior to working at H2O.ai, I was the Principal Data Scientist at Wise.io (acquired by GE Digital in 2016) and Marvin Mobile Security (acquired by Veracode in 2012).  I am also the founder of <a href="http://datascientific.com/">DataScientific, Inc.</a>

I received my Ph.D. in Biostatistics with a Designated Emphasis in Computational Science and Engineering from UC Berkeley. I have a B.S. and M.A. in Mathematics and have worked for many years in industry as a software developer and data scientist. My research focuses on ensemble machine learning, learning from imbalanced binary-outcome data, influence curve based variance estimation and statistical computing.

My dissertation is titled, <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~ledell/papers/ledell-phd-thesis.pdf"> "Scalable Ensemble Learning and Computationally Efficient Variance Estimation"</a> and was awarded the 2015 Erich L. Lehmann Citation by the UC Berkeley Department of Statistics.  At Berkeley, I was co-advised by <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~laan/Laan/laan.html">Mark J. van der Laan</a> and <a href="http://www.sph.berkeley.edu/maya-petersen">Maya L. Petersen</a>.
